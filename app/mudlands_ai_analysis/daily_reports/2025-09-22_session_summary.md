#### Automation Tools:
- `monitor_ai_characters.sh` - Monitors character pipeline
- Testing instructions document for manual QA
- Auto-player configuration system
- API integration endpoints defined

### Next Steps for Human Team:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Review character profiles in `ready_for_testing` folder
   - Test Elder Thaddeus first (establishes political framework)
   - Implement Razorclaw to address Beast-kin representation

2. **Testing Priority:**
   - High: Thaddeus, Razorclaw, Sister Morwyn
   - Medium: Veiled Scholar, Grizelda
   - Each character has specific testing checklist

3. **Integration Path:**
   - Manual testing → Approval → Auto-player activation
   - Monitor script can run continuously or on-demand
   - Daily reports track progress automatically

### Technical Integration:

The system is designed to work with your existing Node.js/Socket.io infrastructure:

```javascript
// Suggested API endpoints to implement:
POST /api/characters/load-from-ai      // Load new characters
PUT  /api/characters/:id/status        // Update testing status
POST /api/characters/:id/enable-auto   // Activate auto-play
GET  /api/ai-analysis/latest          // Get latest analysis
```

### Success Metrics:
- Fill critical story gaps ✅
- Increase faction representation ✅
- Add moral complexity ✅
- Enable new storylines ✅
- Maintain world consistency ✅

### Notes:
- All characters designed to integrate with existing lore
- Hidden antagonist (Veiled Scholar) requires careful testing
- Beast-kin integration addresses major narrative gap
- Political tensions now properly represented
- Religious mystery added for long-term engagement
