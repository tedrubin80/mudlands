# MUDlands Online - Storytelling Toolkit

## 1. Room Description Framework

### **The Five Senses Template**
Every room should engage multiple senses:

```markdown
**Visual**: [What players see - architecture, lighting, objects]
**Auditory**: [Sounds - ambient noise, conversations, nature]
**Olfactory**: [Smells - cooking, flowers, decay, smoke]
**Tactile**: [Temperature, humidity, textures they might touch]
**Atmospheric**: [The emotional feeling of the space]
```

### **Room Description Formula**
1. **Opening Hook** (1 sentence) - Immediate impression
2. **Primary Details** (2-3 sentences) - Main features
3. **Secondary Elements** (1-2 sentences) - Smaller details
4. **Interactive Hooks** (1 sentence) - Things players can examine

### **Example Room Description**
```
The ancient library stretches into shadow, its vaulted ceiling lost in darkness above. Towering bookcases line the walls, their shelves mostly empty save for the occasional tome that somehow survived the centuries. The air carries the scent of old parchment and dust, while a gentle draft whispers through broken windows, stirring loose pages that dance like ghostly butterflies. Soft footsteps echo strangely in the vast space, and you notice that some books seem to glow with a faint, inner light.
```

## 2. NPC Personality System

### **The VOICE Method**
- **V**alues: What they believe in
- **O**bjectives: What they want
- **I**dentity: How they see themselves
- **C**onflicts: What opposes them
- **E**motion: How they typically feel

### **NPC Dialogue Templates**

#### **Greeting Patterns**
- **Friendly**: "Well met, traveler! What brings you to [location]?"
- **Cautious**: "You're not from around here... state your business."
- **Mysterious**: "Interesting. I've been expecting someone like you."
- **Busy**: "Quick now, I haven't got all day. What do you need?"

#### **Information Sharing**
- **Willing Helper**: "Oh, you want to know about X? Let me tell you..."
- **Bargainer**: "Information like that doesn't come free, friend."
- **Riddler**: "The answer you seek lies where shadows dance in daylight."
- **Fearful**: "I... I shouldn't talk about such things. It's not safe."

### **NPC Consistency Tracker**
```json
{
  "name": "Meren the Shopkeeper",
  "personality": "cautious_but_kind",
  "speech_patterns": ["uses 'dearie' often", "asks about family"],
  "knowledge": ["local gossip", "trade routes", "monster sightings"],
  "goals": ["protect her daughter", "keep shop profitable"],
  "secrets": ["hiding magical supplies", "knows about secret passage"],
  "relationships": {
    "positive": ["town guard captain", "local farmers"],
    "negative": ["tax collector", "bandits"],
    "complex": ["mysterious regular customer"]
  }
}
```

## 3. Quest Narrative Structure

### **The Hero's Journey Adapted for MUDs**

#### **Phase 1: The Call**
- Player discovers a problem or opportunity
- Personal stakes are established
- World context is provided

#### **Phase 2: The Journey**
- Multiple steps/locations required
- Obstacles that test different skills
- Allies and enemies encountered

#### **Phase 3: The Trial**
- Major challenge or boss fight
- Player must use everything they've learned
- Moral choice or strategic decision

#### **Phase 4: The Return**
- Consequences of actions revealed
- Rewards distributed
- World state potentially changed

### **Quest Hook Templates**

#### **Personal Stakes**
- "Your [family member/friend] has gone missing in [dangerous place]"
- "A mysterious letter arrives asking for help with [personal matter]"
- "You witness [injustice] and must decide whether to act"

#### **Community Need**
- "The town faces [threat] and needs a hero"
- "A valuable [resource/person] has been lost"
- "Ancient [evil/curse] has awakened"

#### **Mystery & Discovery**
- "Strange events occur with no explanation"
- "An ancient map/artifact points to [location]"
- "Someone offers information about your past"

## 4. Environmental Storytelling

### **Show, Don't Tell Principles**

Instead of: "This place was once wealthy but is now poor"
Show: "Faded tapestries hang in tatters from marble walls, and expensive furniture sits covered in dust and cobwebs."

Instead of: "A battle happened here"
Show: "Scorch marks blacken the stone floor, and a broken sword lies half-buried beneath fallen masonry."

### **Layered History Technique**
1. **Surface Layer**: What's immediately obvious
2. **Discovered Layer**: What examination reveals
3. **Hidden Layer**: What investigation uncovers
4. **Secret Layer**: What only specific actions reveal

### **Example Layered Location**
```
Surface: "A peaceful garden with overgrown paths"
Examine plants: "These flowers only bloom in places of great magical power"
Search garden: "You find a hidden stone with strange runes"
Use magic on stone: "The runes glow, revealing an entrance to underground chambers"
```

## 5. Dialogue Writing Guidelines

### **Character Voice Consistency**
- **Noble**: Formal, educated language, complex sentences
- **Commoner**: Simple, direct, uses contractions and slang
- **Scholar**: Precise vocabulary, tends to explain things
- **Warrior**: Brief, action-oriented, practical concerns
- **Child**: Enthusiastic, asks many questions, innocent perspective

### **Subtext and Depth**
Every line should serve multiple purposes:
- Advance the plot
- Reveal character
- Provide world-building
- Create atmosphere

### **Example Multi-Layered Dialogue**
```
Guard: "Nothing to see here, move along."
[Subtext: He's nervous about something]
[Plot: Something IS happening here]
[Character: He follows orders but isn't comfortable]
[World: Guards are told to keep secrets]
```

## 6. Consistency Tools

### **Story Bible Sections**
1. **Character Registry**: All NPCs with key details
2. **Location Catalog**: Every room with lore notes
3. **Timeline Tracker**: When events happen
4. **Relationship Map**: Who knows/likes/hates whom
5. **Mystery Tracker**: What players have learned

### **Content Creation Checklist**
Before adding any story content, ask:
- [ ] Does this fit the world's tone and themes?
- [ ] Is it consistent with established lore?
- [ ] Does it provide player agency/choice?
- [ ] Will it enhance the player experience?
- [ ] Does it connect to larger story threads?

### **Revision Questions**
- Is the language appropriate for the character/setting?
- Are there enough sensory details?
- Does the pacing feel right?
- Are there opportunities for player interaction?
- Does it leave room for mystery and discovery?

## 7. Dynamic Story Elements

### **Branching Narrative Patterns**
```
Player Action → Multiple Possible Outcomes
└── Immediate Consequence
└── Short-term Effect (next session)
└── Long-term Impact (affects end-game)
```

### **Recurring Character Arcs**
- Characters remember past interactions
- Their attitudes change based on player actions
- They have ongoing goals independent of the player
- Their stories can intersect in meaningful ways

### **World State Changes**
- Completed quests alter NPC dialogue
- Player actions affect availability of future quests
- Seasonal or timed events create urgency
- Community reputation affects all interactions
