## 🤖 AI Character System

### Implemented Characters
1. **Elder Thaddeus** - Haunted town leader with guilt-driven narrative
2. **Sister Morwyn** - Mystical healer with prophetic visions
3. **Razorclaw** - Beast-kin outcast fighting for acceptance
4. **The Veiled Scholar** - Secret cultist spreading corruption
5. **Grizelda Ironfoot** - Dwarf explorer seeking lost technology

### AI Scheduling System
- Time-based activity windows (morning, midday, evening, night)
- Behavior patterns matching character personalities
- Dynamic story event generation
- Faction relationship tracking
- 15-45 minute automated play sessions

## 🛡️ Security & Data Protection

### Sanitization Performed
- ✅ Removed all `.env` files with credentials
- ✅ Deleted `node_modules` directories
- ✅ Cleared sensitive backup files
- ✅ Removed database passwords from scripts
- ✅ Sanitized API keys and tokens
- ✅ Created comprehensive `.gitignore`

### Preserved Data
- Game source code and logic
- Character profiles and AI configurations
- World data and room descriptions
- Documentation and setup guides
- Database schema and migrations
- Deployment scripts (sanitized)

## 📊 Lessons Learned

### Technical Insights
1. **Socket.IO Performance**: Handled 50+ concurrent connections smoothly
2. **AI Integration**: Ollama provided excellent narrative generation
3. **Redis Caching**: Significantly improved response times
4. **PostgreSQL**: Robust for persistent game state management
5. **SystemD**: Reliable service management with auto-restart

### Design Decisions That Worked
- Separating game engine from network layer
- Using JSON for game content (easy editing)
- Command pattern for player actions
- Event-driven architecture for real-time updates
- Modular AI character system

### Challenges Encountered
- Managing AI response latency (solved with queuing)
- Balancing combat mechanics (iterative tuning)
- CSRF token management (domain-specific configuration)
- Database password complexity (environment variables)
- Nginx SSL configuration (Let's Encrypt automation)

## 💡 Recommendations for Revival

Should this project be revived:

1. **Review Security**: Update all dependencies and security practices
2. **Modernize Stack**: Consider newer Node.js, TypeScript migration
3. **Add Testing**: Implement comprehensive test coverage
4. **Document APIs**: Use Swagger/OpenAPI for API documentation
5. **Monitor Performance**: Add APM tools (New Relic, DataDog)
6. **Scale Architecture**: Plan for horizontal scaling from start
7. **Community Features**: Add forums, wikis, player guides
8. **Monetization**: Consider freemium model or cosmetic purchases
